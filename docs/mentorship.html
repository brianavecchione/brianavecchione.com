          <h6>Challenge Question: How can sites that are administrative locations rather than service locations be identified in FacDB?</h6>
          <p>I partnered with BetaNYC at the APA National Planning Conference Datajam to ideate a technical methodology for improving location confidence intervals in NYC facilities database.</p>

          <h6>The Problem:</h6>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Misleading Locations</b>: Locations may be inaccurate due to data sources (may refer to org mailing/billing address instead of service location)</li>
            <li><b>Inconsistency</b>: Community based orgs do not have consistent service locations & may provide services at administrative location (unable to make sweeping assumptions)</li>
          </ul>

          <p>We were able to successfully geocode >6k sites and plot using Mapzen. From there, we presented a four-part methodology:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Geocode admin addresses, cross-reference with facilities program sites</li>
            <li>Split by [category] (FACgroup? FACsubgrp?) & Eliminate subgroups that are more likely to be verified (i.e., parks, housing, schools, etc.)</li>
            <li>Manual classification for training set (validate admin service locations vs. service locations) — should be done by subject matter experts. (a. Remove/examine duplicates, b. Use zoning restrictions for location validation)</li>
            <li>Run through ML models for testing set CI</li>
          </ol>

            <h6>Datasets Used:</h6>
            <ul>
              <li><a href="https://carto.capitalplanning.nyc/user/cpadmin/tables/provideradminaddresses/public/map">Administrative addresses from HHS Accelerator</a>: Known administrative addresses for orgs with City contracts and provide social services</li>
              <li><a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/Benefits-and-Programs-API/2j8u-wtju">Operator’s websites and Access NYC API data</a>: Program info provided by organizations and website urls</li>
            </ul>

              <p>The methodology was taken internally by the NYC facilities team.</p>

          <p>HeatSeek is a civic tech nonprofit dedicated to "empowering 
            tenants, landlords, community organizations, and the justice system to tackle our city’s heating crisis". The team places low-cost heat sensors in local residential units to track temperature data and monitor via a webapp. In doing this, they hold landlords accountable, inform housing policy, and provide evidence to verify heating code abuse claims in housing court.</p>

            <p>I was approached by HeatSeek to create a prototype data analytics dashboard comparing public 311 heating complaints with HeatSeek sensors. The team was interested in using Power BI for their analytics because of its ease of use in generating analytics for varying technical abilities. The resulting dashboard can be viewed on the left. There are four main functions:</p>

            <ul>
              <li><b>NYC Trends</b>: Shows rate of change for complaints by zip code</li>
              <li><b>Violation Analysis</b>: Shows addresses with most complaints & their locations</li>
              <li><b>Violation Search</b>: Search tool for monthly violation count per address or apartment unit</li>
              <li><b>Apartment Search</b>: Search tool tracking indoor vs. outdoor temperatures by address or apartment unit </li>
            </ul>

          <h4>2016 National Day of Civic Hacking</h4>
          <p>My team sponsored the NYC Parks TreesCount! DataJam, prompting the city’s civic technology, data, and design communities to to make sense of New York’s latest and most spatially accurate urban forest dataset. The census mapped 530,000 trees, including the entirety of Manhattan, The Bronx, and Staten Island (80% of all NYC streets). Some goals and challenges revolved around quantifying how NYC’s forest has changed over time, understanding how the census can be correlated with local economic and environmental indicators, increasing civic stewardship/education, and improving its current and future health. I wrote a blog post recapping my team's participation and project submission <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/newyork/2016/06/22/nyc-treescount-data-jam-a-day-of-civic-voluntreeism/">here</a>.</p>
          <h4>NYC Open Data for All Workshop: Mentor</h4>
          <p>NYC Parks has been offering free programs at the city's Computer Resource Centers to support public access to open data. The workshops introduce participants to the NYC Open Data portal and teach basic analysis skills. I served as a mentor for the first NYC Open Data for All Workshop: "Digging into TreesCount! Data". At this workshop, I helped train and answer questions from participants around data collection, manipulation, analysis, and visualization.</p>

          <p>Recently, New York's city council decided to pilot 'Paperless Stated', an initiative dedicated to reducing paper use and modernizing the nature of civic work. Surfaces were introduced into the City Council's Stated meeting to help members better navigate large documents. During the digital experience, I assisted with training and technical support for city council members who had questions about surface tablets.

          <h6>Description: (Taken from CodeNewbie)</h6>
          <p>"If you've heard of open data, big data, and data science and never quite knew what it was all about, this episode is for you. Briana helps us explore the different steps it takes to answer a complex data question with code, giving us a tour of the data science world along the way. We talk about the importance and difficulty of cleaning data, the role of ethics in data collection and analysis, and how a codenewbie can dig into this fascinating topic."</p>
