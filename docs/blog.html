          <h5>Spring semester, progress</h5>
          <h6>March 13 2019</h6>
          <p>Spring semester has been overall, much smoother. Setting into more of a comfortable rhythm comes with increased productivity, which I'm loving. 
            I've been less hesitant to contribute to academic dicussion without the overwhelming fear of judgment. I didn't want to present myself as a PhD
            student who knows all the answers, and I generally approach new situations by listening more than talking until I feel like I've found more of a 
          place in the environment. Anyway, here are some goings-on lately:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>I'm still working on pushing out datasheets (only been a year in the making!!) with the MSR group. The upside of having a lengthy and uncertain 
            first-publishing experience is A.) continued opportunity to learn from and work with people who've I'd admired since I was an undergrad and B.)
            exposure to the political and publishing landscape that often delays venue publications or otherwise causes work-in-progress to come to somewhat
            of a standstill. Still, I've been really enjoying taking on more responsibility during this second round, and it's been amazing to work with 
            people who've been supportive, welcoming, and encouraging of my professional growth. Mentorship matters, mentorship matters, mentorship matters.</li>
              <li>I signed a summer offer with Spotify!! I'll be working as a Research Scientist on their Algorithmic Bias team in NYC. I am way too excited 
              about this. It's been a dream of mine to spend some time here (also since I was an undergrad). I'm finding that lots of hopes I incubated during my 
              junior years in computing are coming to fruition. It's both scary and exciting!</li>
              <li>I found out I won an academic scholarship yesterday, which was both a surprise and a relief. I've been somewhat stressed about the (lack of) 
                time I've found myself putting into funding applications for future years. I'm planning on starting NSF GRFP and NDSEG applications this summer 
                and I'm on fellowship this year so I'm not 'technically' under advisor payroll yet, but I'd like to have the freedom to keep it that way. I love 
                collaborating with my department, but I'm the kind of person who prefers to be self-sufficient when it comes to financial support. Anyway, the 
                scholarship doesn't cover the full year of funding, but it makes a dent. I think it also comes with a trip to the bay in the summer, so that's fun.</li>
              <li>My little sister is 14 years old and I enrolled as a lottery candidate to attend Cornell's 'Expanding Your Horizons' conference for girls in 7-9th 
                grade who are interested in science. She was selected this week and will be coming to Cornell for a the conference, which happens to be on my birthday.
                Even better, each student is assigned a Cornell 'buddy', which means I get to spend all day with her showing her around and exposing her to opportunity.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>That being said, there are still challenges. I still feel that I need to improve getting a handle on fundamental relevant works as well as my logic and 
              programmatic technical skills. I'm worried about emerging from a PhD as too much of a generalist. But I'm grateful to be here and I'm happy to work. <p>

          <h5>Baysian inference</h5>
          <h6>11/12/18</h6>
          <p>In my causal inference and design of experiments course up to this point, we've been practicing frequentist inference, or null hypothesis significance testing (NHST). 
            Lately, I've been interested in expanding out to bayesian reasoning, which is particularly useful if you're working with missing or incomplete 
            data (yep) and you're looking to make predictions (also yep). Basically, this logic is interesting for learning because it allows you to incorporate other things you 
            know into the model. More on this as I integrate it into my research.

            <!-- For now, I'm looking at the relationship betweeen receiving financial help and transitioning out of poverty and hardship in NYC using the 
            <a href="http://povertytracker.robinhood.org/#home">Robin Hood Foundation's Poverty Tracker</a> data. -->

            <h5>First Attempt at Doing Something Useful</h5>
            <h6>11/09/18</h6>
            <p class="text-center"><i>“My research project looks at modeling effects of 'shocks' (financial, relationship, illness, crime, arrest) on intergenerational mobility.
            Broadly, I am looking at systems of disadvantage and looking for opportunities to recommend policy/subsidy interventions at critical points of poverty and/or
            disadvantage.”</i></p>
            <p>For my final causal inference project, I'm starting to tackle a minute portion of this vast question by looking at
            <ul>
            <li>2286 households were surveyed, with 2144 recieving benefits and 142 not recieving benefits</li>
            <li></li>
          </ul> -->

          <h5>Somewhere between self-help and intellectualism</h5>
          <h6>November 09 2018</h6>
          <p>I feel like I had an ~intellectual breakthrough~ this week and it's been intensely stress-relieving. Beginning a PhD is challenging and dynamic in ways I hadn't 
          anticipated and one of the things I've been struggling with is an intense level of imposter syndrome in academia 
          (<a href="https://www.chronicle.com/article/How-to-Overcome-Impostor/244700">Spoiler alert—it's normal!!!</a>). Jury's still out on whether I'll be able to remember 
          this fact next week.</p>
          
          <p>My mind has been intensely preoccupied by the <a href="https://thehardestscience.com/2016/08/11/everything-is-fucked-the-syllabus/">
          prominence of p-hacking, the reproducibility crisis, and the push for open science</a> and it's made me fundamentally 
          question my purpose as a researcher and the legitimacy of scientific fields (maybe dramatic, but also honest). If what we, as scientists, accept as 'fact' is so 
          heavily subject to potentially biased statistical processes/results, constrained by underfunding, and validated based on general consensus, how are researchers 
          expected to be confident in the legitimacy of results, both our own or others? It seems that there isn't a current way to estimate how much of the reproducibility 
          problem is the fault of siloed research and ulterior agendas vs. our own limitations in understanding the 'gold standard' of scientific discovery. Further, the fact 
          that hard sciences are not exempt from these issues seems deeply concerning, given their prominence in the daily economy and everyday life. A professor (and possibly 
          growing mentor?) of mine pointed me in the direction of <a href="https://osf.io/">OSF</a> and some work on 
          <a href="http://www.indiana.edu/~kruschke/articles/Kruschke2013JEPG.pdf">baysian inference</a>, which I'm excited to delve into. I'm coming out of this week with 
          the simultanous knowledge that science is messy, progress happens after you consistently fail and *maybe* discover some stroke of incrementalism, and any scientist who 
          presents with ego about being confident in their ability to do 'cutting-edge research' is kidding themselves. None of us really know what we're doing and that's okay.

          <p>I've also been trying to get some research off the ground that looks into systems of inequality (read: I am wrestling with longitudinal social science data and am 
            frustrated by the nature of its high-dimensionality). Beginning a project is typically the most tumultuous for me because I'm easily overwhelmed by the amount of information 
            to be combed through. This, coupled with hesitancy in my own knowledge of 'best practice' in my field (what my field <i>is</i>, I'm not really sure) has been...a 
            humbling experience. I should go try and make some real progress on that now before my check-in with a fourth-year candidate this afternoon.</p>
