          <h5>Somewhere between self-help and intellectualism</h5>
          <h6>11/09/18</h6>
          <p>I feel like I had an ~intellectual breakthrough~ this week and it's been intensely stress-relieving. Beginning a PhD is challenging and dynamic in ways I hadn't 
          anticipated and one of the things I've been struggling with is an intense level of imposter syndrome in academia 
          (<a href="https://www.chronicle.com/article/How-to-Overcome-Impostor/244700">Spoiler alertâ€”it's normal!!!</a>). Jury's still out on whether I'll be able to remember 
          this fact next week.</p>
          
          <p>My mind has been intensely preoccupied by the prominence of p-hacking, the reproducibility crisis, and the push for open science and it's made me fundamentally 
          question my purpose as a researcher and the legitimacy of scientific fields (maybe dramatic, but also honest). If what we, as scientists, accept as 'fact' is so 
          heavily subject to potentially biased statistical processes/results, constrained by underfunding, and validated based on general consensus, how are researchers 
          expected to be confident in the legitimacy of results, both our own or others? It seems that there isn't a current way to estimate how much of the reproducibility 
          problem is the fault of siloed research and ulterior agendas vs. our own limitations in understanding the 'gold standard' of scientific discovery. Further, the fact 
          that hard sciences are not exempt from these issues seems deeply concerning, given their prominence in the daily economy and everyday life. A professor (and possibly 
          growing mentor?) of mine pointed me in the direction of <a href="https://osf.io/">OSF</a> and some work on 
          <a href="http://www.indiana.edu/~kruschke/articles/Kruschke2013JEPG.pdf">baysian inference</a>, which I'm excited to delve into. I'm coming out of this week with 
          the simultanous knowledge that science is messy, progress happens after you consistently fail and *maybe* discover some stroke of incrementalism, and any scientist who 
          presents with ego about being confident in their ability to do 'cutting-edge research' is kidding themselves. None of us really know what we're doing and that's okay.

          <p>I've also been trying to get some research off the ground that looks into systems of inequality (read: I am wrestling with longitudinal social science data and am 
            frustrated by the nature of its high-dimensionality). Beginning a project is typically the most tumultuous for me because I'm easily overwhelmed by the amount of information 
            to be combed through. This, coupled with hesitancy in my own knowledge of 'best practice' in my field (what my field <i>is</i>, I'm not really sure) has been...a 
            humbling experience. I should go try and make some real progress on that now before my check-in with a fourth-year candidate this afternoon.</p>
