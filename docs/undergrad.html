          <p>I was nominated within my department to participate in Aalto University Design Factoryâ€™s Product Development Project (PDP) as a software engineer. PDP combines students from Aalto University (Helsinki), Pace University (NYC), and Tongii University (Shanghai). Our team was sponsored by Swedish-Swiss automation company <a href="http://new.abb.com/">ABB</a>. The company wanted a new ship control system that allowed for easier manipulation of electric podded azimuth thrusters. To do this, I worked with a small engineering team to build a web interface in JavaScript, program Arduino code in C, and build a web server to communicate between the two. My team was awarded 3rd place and most innovative out of 50+ teams and was featured in Finland's largest newspaper and television outlet.

      <h3>FRB Time Series Analysis</h3>

        <div class="col-sm-8">
          <p>At the Federal Reserve Board, I was tasked to create a visual dashboard of the "quality" & "efficiency" of all time series ETL data releases. I performed statistical analysis to analyze runtime, metadata quality, and automation. Visualizations were built into a final report that I presented to the entire division of the Office of the Chief Data Officer. I also built and presented a prototype of the dashboard process. The learnings were continued internally after the end of my internship. Much of the code remains internal, but one script is available on <a href="https://github.com/brianavecchione/Time-Series-Analysis-/blob/master/Clean_Data.R">GitHub</a>.</p>

          <p>This project visualizes web traffic for a single endpoint within a 10-minute interval by parsing JSON data and analyzing locations of growth. This was originally assigned as a 24 hour interview project. The repository can be found on <a href="https://github.com/brianavecchione/JSON-Analysis-Visualization">GitHub</a>.</p>

          <p>When I started getting a lot of questions from students and others interested in trying out data science, I compiled my resources into an open-source list for contribution. It was featured on <a href="https://www.codenewbie.org/podcast/intro-to-data-science">CodeNewbie Ep. 137: Intro to Data Science"</a>.
