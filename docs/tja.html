      <p>Tech Jobs Academy (TJA) is an intensive, 18-week technical training program providing skills in cloud and server administration crated by Microsoft New York's Technology & Civic Engagement team. The program is a reaction to New York City's skills gap and aims to expand access to in-demand technical training to unemployed or underemployed adults who are passionate about launching careers in technology. TJA's learning model blends hard skills and soft skills, pairing a focus on real-world projects with labs, lecture, and certification exams. Throughout the program, each participant completes roughly 1,000 hours of high-quality skills development.</p>

      <p>The program went through two pilot iterations in New York City. We collaborated with the Mayor's Tech Talent Pipeline and the New York City College of Technology to deliver administration skills to 50 trainees from an applicant pool of over 500. In addition to developing strong collaboration and technical writing abilities, participants had the opportunity to become Microsoft Certified Professionals (MCP), Microsoft Certified Solutions Associates (MCSA), and Microsoft Certified Solutions Experts (MCSE), which have been shown to increase employability and compensation. At the end of the program, participants were able to build connections with numerous local businesses — including the hundreds of thousands of Microsoft partner companies worldwide – in need of precisely these 21st century skills.</p>

    <h5>My roles in the program were as follows:</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Design data standard, analytics workflow, and git workflow</li>
      <li>Clean data for machine-readability</li>
      <li>Setup internal spreadsheets to accommodate varying technical ability</li>
      <li>Generate data visualizations for playbook and booklet</li>
      <li>Perform various manual analysis using R</li>
      <li>Give mock technical interviews to TJA students</li>
      <li>Provide necessary updates to TJA website</li>
      <li>Train internal team members to use visualization workflow in Power BI</li>
    </ul>

<p>The program culminated in a series of documents & tools that have been open-sourced for outside groups looking to build future technical training programs. See below:</p>
