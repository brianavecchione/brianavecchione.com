      <h1 class="my-4">Diversity Statement</h1>
      <hr>

      <p>The life I lead now has been defined by two key challenges from my childhood: A transgender father who publicly pushed the boundaries of society, and the resulting 15-year custody battle with my mother. These circumstances have made me recognize that I have an emotional and intellectual choice in responding: to be blameful and complacent or to acknowledge accountability and react with agency and grace. The crucible of uncertainty by virtue of my adversities has been a motivator in becoming more focused and autonomous. I’m grateful for the challenges I’ve encountered because they’ve afforded me the opportunity to solve problems with creativity and resilience.</p>

      <p>My father was one of the first to undergo gender reassignment surgery in the state of California, jumpstarting my childhood with an early lesson on diversity. I was a year old when my parents divorced, which sparked a precedent-setting child custody court case over transgender parental rights. Growing up, I frequented the offices of attorneys, evaluators, judges, and psychologists. It didn’t take long for me to learn that the voice of a child holds little weight in custodial matters. Feeling limited control of my own guardianship, I found solace in channeling the angst I experienced towards my academics. I excelled in school in a way that I could not self- guide my personal life—This inverse relationship became my lesson in mastering grit and persistence as a child.</p>

      <p>Nearly 15 years after it started, as I hoped, my father won custody. By this time, I was able to express my own voice and interests, but I was struggling with my sexuality and the burden of coming out as a teenager. I had assumed that I would feel ‘normal’ once a definite custodial decision was made. Instead, I grappled with internal friction while realizing that I was a member of the LGBT+ community. Unlike my experience with the custody case, the decision to unveil my identity was mine alone. Understanding that my prior experiences had given me enough self- awareness to recognize my preferences made coming out far less onerous.</p>

      <p>The court case placed extreme financial demand on my family. I graduated high school with a final GPA of 4.5 out of 5, but there was no money for me to attend college. I was reliant on scholarships, grants, loans and odd-jobs in order to support myself. It was not uncommon for me to take a full course load and work up to 40 hours a week. Although the days were long, I’ve never regretted my decision to attend university in a city that offered unparalleled opportunities and the challenge to further develop autonomy outside of my comfort zone. The time- management, inventive problem solving, and commitment I formed during this time gave me the freedom to come into an identity unburdened by dependency on others.</p>

      <p>Contrary to what might ordinarily be a deterrent, the discussion around the need for diversity in technology was the catalyst for my professional interest. I saw a distinct opportunity
for impact when I realized that technical fields were imbued with uniformity. As a young woman in computer science, I faced several instances of doubt, discrimination, and harassment from both peers and professors. This contributed to a sense of alienation and “imposter syndrome”, so I decided to intentionally seek out supportive communities. I applied and was accepted as a Grace Hopper Scholar (GHC) and was the sole representative from my university in 2015. GHC exposed me to the difference that diversity could have on recruitment and retention, so I immediately founded the ‘Women in Tech’ club in my computer science department. We held resume workshops, events, and GHC application reviews. The next year, we had 13 attendees at GHC—many of whom found internships and full-time opportunities because of their participation. My subsequent pursuits in diversity led to various speaking and traveling opportunities both nationally and abroad. I graduated Magna-cum-laude as one of three women in my class. This experience was invaluable and taught me to establish myself professionally and maintain confidence in my potential to contribute in meaningful ways.</p>

<p>As a first-generation graduate student, I will continue to face challenges that go uncharted. I’m well aware that pursuing an interdisciplinary degree requires a dedicated and substantial effort to master multiple disciplines at once. Still, I’ve always used my education as a primary avenue for self-betterment, and I consider entry into a graduate degree no exception. I’m notably excited at the prospect of devoting myself to a field I believe will grow and develop. I know that continuing my education offers a rewarding experience for both myself and my family. I feel that realizing my interests validates the hurdles many of us must face in making opportunities like graduate school accessible for me. Most importantly, I’m confident that my continued education will enable cherished scholarly growth in exchange for a dedicated academic effort and relevant intellectual contributions.</p>
