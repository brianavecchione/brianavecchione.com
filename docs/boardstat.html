      <h3>Building Civic Tools Using Democratized 311 Service Requests</h3>

      <p>
      In recent weeks, Microsoft has been collaborating with the Manhattan Borough President’s Office and BetaNYC to develop civic tools for local community boards. New York City currently organizes 59 community boards (CB) which provide oversight of municipal service delivery. Each CB is comprised of two full-time employees and a varying number of volunteer representatives. Oftentimes, this limited bandwidth causes hardships in engaging effectively with the digital landscape. It was decided that a digital tool was needed to help alleviate such struggles.</p>
 
      <p>For three years, the Manhattan Borough President’s Office has been looking for a way to explore how 311 service request data can be integrated into Community Boards’ decision-making processes. To expedite the process, BetaNYC, Manhattan Borough President Gale A. Brewer, and Fund for the City of New York developed the NYC Civic Innovation Fellows Program, supported by Data & Society Research Foundation as well as the Mayor’s Office of Data Analytics’ “Open Data for All” initiative. This program was founded with the intent to “develop digital and open data practices that [serve] local constituencies”.</p>
 
      <p>To help support the project, we brought in a team of subject-matter experts from Chicago and New York to teach a one-day Deep Dive Workshop on Power BI, Microsoft’s Business Intelligence tool. By the end of the session, the team had completed its first iteration of “BoardStat”, an interactive service visualizing 311 service requests between the years of 2010 and 2017.</p>
 
      <p>For a series of weeks afterward, the tool was in functional testing to illuminate demands for modifications and improvements. I served as the team’s developer and met with BetaNYC to provide feature implementations and collect user testing feedback from Board Liaisons. We found that Liaisons were most interested in using the report to give monthly summaries on dynamic 311 data insights (i.e. 30% increase in noise complaints). The ability to generate data-driven insights about 311 usages proved to be compelling for both government and community constituents: By using data as supporting evidence for anecdotal complaints, Boards are empowered to make sound decisions with better transparency and citizens are motivated to civically engage by seeing that their complaints are being visualized and acted upon.</p>
 
      <p>Currently, BoardStat is released in Beta for all 12 of Manhattan’s community boards. Eventually, the tool will be embedded into each CB’s website for public access. The project was the theme for the 2017 NYC National Day of Civic Hacking.</p>
