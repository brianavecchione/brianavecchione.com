                <h2>About Me</h2>

                <p>Hey, I'm Briana, a Silicon Alley based student, hacker, speaker, and tap dancer. I'm an alumna of the <a href="https://ds3.research.microsoft.com/">Microsoft Research DS3</a> program, where I created statistical models and designed algorithms to fix the uneven distribution of bike-sharing programs worldwide. This past summer, I worked as a data science intern under the Office of the Chief Data Officer at the <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/default.htm">Federal Reserve Board of Governors</a>, where I built a dashboard for their time series data release ETL processes.I'm also an alumna of <a href="https://squareup.com/code-camp/college">Square Code Camp</a>, a week-long immersion program with technical workshops, a hackathon, and leadership sessions with Jack Dorsey and Sarah Friar.</p>

                <p>Currently, I serve as the Head of Operations for <a href="https://www.facebook.com/wogrammerny">wogrammer New York</a>, the first chapter launched under the <a href="http://wogrammer.org/">wogrammer</a> mission to celebrate, support, and connect accomplished women in tech in the New York area. If you know someone you'd like to nominate for a feature, email me at [firstname].[lastname]@gmail.com.</p>

                <p>I'm passionate about recruitment, retention, and inclusivity in tech. You can often find me speaking on these topics at various conferences and events around the US. Locally, I founded the Pace University Lean-In Circle and serve on the board of <a href="https://tenxlist.com/">TenXList</a>, referral-based community for young women in science and technology. Finally, I'm a 2-time Grace Hopper Celebration Scholar as well as a scholarship recipient of the 2015 Tapia Celebration.</p>

                <p>You can always keep up with what I'm <a href="http://vsco.co/brianavecchione/grid/1">photographing</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/1264078733">listening to</a>, or <a href="https://nomadtrips.co/brianavecchione">traveling for</a> here.</p>

            <h3>Microsoft Research: Self-Balancing Bikes</h3>
            <p>A data analysis project to create a rerouting scheme for riders to self-balance the Citi Bike system. We anticipate that we can decrease vehicle transportations by offering financial incentives to take bikes from relatively full stations and return bikes to relatively empty stations (with rerouting advice provided via an app). We used publicly available data obtained via the CitiBike website, consisting of starting and ending locations, times, and user characteristics for each trip taken from July 2013 through May 2014. Using this dataset, we estimated CitiBike traffic flow, which enabled us to build agent-based simulation models in response to incentives and rerouting information. By estimating various parameters under which to organize incentive schemes, we found that such a program would help to improve CitiBike's environmentalism and increase productivity, as well as being financially beneficial for both CitiBike and its riders. I presented this research at the 2014 Association of Computing Machinery's SIGKDD at Bloomberg conference and 2015 ACM Richard Tapia Celebration of Diversity in Computing conference, where we were awarded 2nd place nationwide in Undergraduate Research. See our <a href="https://ds3.research.microsoft.com/doc/citibike.pdf">extended abstract</a>, <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/apps/video/default.aspx?id=226601">video presentation</a>, or view it on <a href="https://github.com/brianavecchione/self_balancing_bikes">Github</a>. </p>

            <h3>Federal Reserve Board of Governors: Time Series ETL Dashboard</h3>
            <p>The time series dashboard was developed in order to visualize and display the efficiency of internal time series data release ETL processes within the Office of the Chief Data Officer at the Federal Reserve Board. The dashboard KPIs were split into the categories of 'timeliness' and 'quality' and required implementation of new data collection features within each set of series per data release. I ran preliminary statistics on the status of current releases and presented my findings and recommendations for data rearchitecture to division-wide management. View it on <a href="https://github.com/brianavecchione/Time-Series-Analysis-/blob/master/Clean_Data.R">Github</a>.</p>

            <h3>Aalto University Design Factory: ABB Helm</h3>
            <p>Helm is a ship control interface which seeks to revolutionize modern Azipod-powered vessels. By digitizing the manuals and streamlining the information display, we created an ergonomic and intuitive user experience. As a technical engineer, I built servers, wrote Arduino code, and interfaced a JavaScript web application. Helm was awarded 3rd Place through the <a href="http://pdp.fi/">Aalto University Product Development Project</a> and sponsored by <a href="http://www.abb.com/">ABB</a>.</p>

            <h3>Data For Development: Senegal</h3>
            <p>A data for development challenge sponsored by Orange Telecommunications and MIT Media Lab. Worked with a team of researchers and professors from US and Senegal to use anonymized mobile datasets provided by Orange to improve the social welfare of the Senegalese people. Our focus was on health and migration in Senegal during significant religious festivals. This project involved conducting extensive background research, data analysis using R, application of machine learning models, and CartoDB for data visualization. Results of the challenge were presented at the NetMob 2015 conference at the MIT Media Lab in Boston, MA. View it on <a href="https://github.com/brianavecchione/D4D-Senegal">Github</a>.</p>

            <h3>Visualization of URL Scalability</h3>
            <p>A script written to parse and analyze a streaming JSON dataset. The project focuses on the scalability of URL sharing by visualizing the growth rate of all non-repeat clients clicking the most shared user hash ID within a 10-minute interval. In order to do this, I selected the most active user hash ID and filtered all non-repeat clients for visualization formatting. I then imported geocoder data through Google Maps API calls in order to generate the final plot. View it on <a href="https://github.com/brianavecchione/JSON-Analysis-Visualization">Github</a>.</p>

            <h3>Square Code Camp: The Generations</h3>
            <p>The Generations platform is a Ruby on Rails web application created to connect and sustain a network of code camp alumni. We used geo-location data to map the current location of code camp alumni and school, generation year, and interest data as filters for each participant.
